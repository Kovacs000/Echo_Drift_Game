# Echo Driift

**Echo Driift** is a short, single-player psychological horror experience set in deep space. Built in Unreal Engine, the game blends exploration with a slow-burn narrative, as players uncover a forgotten mission aboard a drifting vessel while their sense of reality quietly deteriorates.

The title is intentionally stylized with two "i"s — *Echo Driift* — to reflect its distorted atmosphere and themes.

## About the Game

Echo Driift is designed to be completed in a single 8-minute session. Time is represented by a sanity bar, which gradually drains throughout the experience. There’s no visible timer — just a subtle progress indicator quietly ticking away.

### Core Gameplay

- Explore a derelict ship and complete **two main objectives** to unlock the ending.
- Optional content includes **hidden crew logs** that provide backstory and deepen the narrative.
- There is minimal looting; the emphasis is on atmosphere, exploration, and psychological tension.

It’s an experience designed more to unsettle than to challenge, with pacing and sound doing most of the heavy lifting.

## Final Thoughts

Echo Driift is best played with headphones, in a dark room, and without interruption. It’s a short game, but it’s meant to leave a lasting impression — not with jump scares, but with atmosphere and isolation.
